## Project Overview


This repository contains the code and documentation for my summer internship project focused on **Cyber Threat Detection using Machine Learning**. This project was undertaken at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Girijananda Chowdhury University, Guwahati.


In an increasingly digital world, the ability to proactively identify and neutralize cyber threats is paramount. This project explores the application of various machine learning algorithms to detect and classify malicious activities, contributing to a more secure cyber environment.


## Futuristic Theme Integration


The project's theme embraces a futuristic vision of cybersecurity, where intelligent systems autonomously learn and adapt to evolving threats. Visual elements and descriptions aim to reflect this forward-thinking approach.


## Key Features


* Implementation of cutting-edge machine learning models for threat detection.
* Analysis of relevant datasets to train and evaluate the models.
* Exploration of feature engineering techniques to enhance detection accuracy.
* A modular and well-documented codebase for future development.


## Technologies Used


* Python
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow/Keras (optional, depending on the models used)
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
